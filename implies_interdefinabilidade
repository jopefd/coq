Definition lem : Prop :=
forall (p : Prop), (p \/ ~p).

Theorem implies_interdef_1 :
forall (p q : Prop), (p -> q) -> (~p \/ q).
lem -> forall (p q : Prop), (p -> q) -> (~p \/ q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  assert (Hpimpq: p -> q).
  { intro Hp.  contradi
  intros Hlem p q.
  intro Hpimpq.
  assert 
  destruct (Hlem p) as [Hp | Hnp].
  - apply Hpimpq in Hp as Hq.
    right.
    assumption.
  - left.
    assumption.
Qed.

Theorem implies_interdef_2 :
forall (p q : Prop), (~p \/ q) -> (p -> q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  intro Hnporq.
  intro Hp.
  destruct Hnporq as [Hnp | Hq].
  - apply Hnp in Hp as Hfalse.
    contradiction.
  - assumption.

Proof.
  intros p q.
  intro Hporq.
  destruct Hporq as [Hp | Hq].
  - intro Hnp.
    contradiction.
  - intro Hnp.
