Definition lem : Prop :=
forall (p : Prop), (p \/ ~p).

Theorem interdef1_or_and :  
forall (p q : Prop), (p \/ q) -> ~(~p /\ ~q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  intro Hporq.
  unfold not.
  intro Hnpandnq.
  destruct Hnpandnq as [Hnp Hnq].
  destruct Hporq as [Hp | Hq].
  - apply Hnp in Hp.
    assumption.
  - apply Hnq in Hq.
    assumption.

Theorem interdef2_or_and :  
lem -> forall (p q : Prop), ~(~p /\ ~q) -> (p \/ q).
Proof.
  intros Hlem p q.
  intro Hnnpornq.
  unfold not in Hnnpornq.
  destruct (Hlem p) as [Hp | Hnp].
  - left.
    assumption.
  - unfold not in Hnp.
    right.
    destruct (Hlem q) as [Hq | Hnq].
    + assumption.
    + unfold not in Hnq.
      assert (Seila: ~p /\ ~q).
      * split.
        -- assumption.
        -- assumption.
      * apply Hnnpornq in Seila.
        contradiction.

  intro Hnpornq.
  destruct Hpandq as [Hp Hq].
  destruct Hnpornq as [Hnp | Hnq].
  - apply Hnp in Hp.
