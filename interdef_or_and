Definition lem : Prop :=
forall (p : Prop), (p \/ ~p).

Theorem interdef1_or_and :  
forall (p q : Prop), (p \/ q) -> ~(~p /\ ~q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  intro Hporq.
  unfold not.
  intro Hnpandnq.
  destruct Hnpandnq as [Hnp Hnq].
  destruct Hporq as [Hp | Hq].
  - apply Hnp in Hp.
    assumption.
  - apply Hnq in Hq.
    assumption.
